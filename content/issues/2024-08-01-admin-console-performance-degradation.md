*Report Received | 11:00am Central* - We are investigating a potential issue that might affect the uptime of one our of services. Adobe has reported that administrators are experiencing reduced performance when accessing the Adobe Admin Console. The Atelic Technology Services Department has not been able to validate this report but we are monitoring further updates from Adobe. This is only affecting internal administration of the Adobe account within the Technology Services Department and therefore no end user impact is expected at this time.
