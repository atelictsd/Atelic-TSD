*Report Received | 11:24am Central*Â - We are investigating a potential issue that might affect the uptime of one of our services. FortiGate reports that access to FortiGate Cloud is unavailable at this time. The Atelic Technology Services Department has been able to validate this report and are monitoring further updates from FortiGate. No end user disruption is expected currently, however members of the Technology Services Department will be unable to manage all FortiGate appliances via FortiGate Cloud at this time and instead should use the IPsec VPN tunnels.
